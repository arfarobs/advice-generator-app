## Overview

This is the first time that I have used React for a Frontend Mentor project. I know it is a bit of an overkill, but I just want to practice my React skills. Any feedback would be appreciated (especially on the React side of things.)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
